## Blocks

::: info

This is an info block. (I think that's what you call these idk)

TODO: Figure out what you call them (jk)

1. Open Scratch
2. Close Scratch

## Scratchblocks

> Probably the first thing I should be testing tbh

```sb
move (10) steps
say [Scratch 3.0 is peak]
yay
yay
```

This is a ::sb scratch block:: used inline. ::sb <(yes) = (2)>::

lololololololololololol

```sb2
think [If I ever wanna document obsolete blocks...] for (3) secs
say [I'll be using this!] for (2) secs
```

The ::sb2 (costume #):: block is a block that existed in Scratch 2.0. It was replaced with ::sb (costume [number v]):: in Scratch 3.0. Both are functionally the same.

::: warning

I am having slight trouble making the blocks look nice in some edge cases, so until I can make it more properly stylized, it is best not to overly rely on the blocks plugin.

* Note to myself since I'm the only one writing this :>

::: info
Pointless feature but cool I guess. Totally didn't [steal](https://sripkunda.me/Discord-Emoji-Extractor/) any from the Scratch Everywhere! Discord server... heh... heh... heh heh... you have no proof! :nategrin:
